German designer Sebastian Stapelfeldt, better known as [carlhauser](https://www.carlhauser.com), captures the essence of the iconic Game Boy with Dynamo, blending a friendly, modern aesthetic.

In two color variations and a minimalist design, the concept strikes a perfect balance between retro and modern, evoking a sense of nostalgia and freshness.

The most surprising feature of this concept is the detachable screenâ€”it can be removed and placed on a surface, for example. This function enhances usability, offering flexibility during gameplay.

I must admit: Iâ€™d love to have this handheld!
